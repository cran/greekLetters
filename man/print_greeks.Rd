\description{
Function to Print all Greek letters and mathematical symbols names.
}
\details{
It is recommended that the font size of the R console be increased for
better visualization of the symbols,
as some of the symbols are quite small.

The subscripts and supersripts are restricted to numbers 0 to 9.

Symbols printed as a "rectangle" don't work in RGui, but these symbols work normally in RStudio.
