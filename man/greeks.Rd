\title{Function that returns strings with Greek letters}
\usage{
greeks(greekletter)
}
\arguments{
\item{greekletter}{is a string that contains the Greek letter name.}
}
\value{
Returns the desired Greek letter or mathematical symbol in string format.
}
\description{
Function to obtain strings with Greek letters and mathematical symbols
with or without subscripts and superscripts.
}
\details{
It is recommended that the font size of the R console be increased for
better visualization of the symbols,
as some of the symbols are quite small.

The subscripts and supersripts are restricted to numbers 0 to 9.

For users working with Rgui this function don't accept subscripts and just accept superscripts 1, 2 and 3. For more details run the commands:

symbols printed as a "rectangle" don't work in RGui, but these symbols work normally in RStudio.

To see names of symbols use \code{\link{print_greeks}}.

# Linear regression
paste("y", " = X", greeks("beta"), " + ", greeks("epsilon"), sep ="")

# pi constant
paste(greeks("pi"), greeks("almostEqual"), "3.14")

# Expected value
paste("E[X] = ", greeks("integral"), "xf(x)dx", sep = "")

greeks("sigma^2")

greeks("Delta^5")

greeks("yourname^9")

# testing statistical hypothesis
paste(greeks("H_0"),":", greeks("mu"), " = 0")
