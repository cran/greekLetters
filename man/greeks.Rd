\description{
Function to obtain strings with Greek letters and mathematical symbols
with or without subscripts and superscripts
}
\details{
It is recommended that the font size of the R console be increased for
better visualization of the symbols,
as some of the symbols are quite small.

The subscripts and supersripts are restricted to numbers 0 to 9.
}
\note{
For users working with Rgui this function don't accept subscripts and just accept superscripts 1, 2 and 3. For more details run the commands:
superscriptSymbols

#symbols printed as a "rectangle" don't work in RGui, but these symbols work normally in RStudio.
